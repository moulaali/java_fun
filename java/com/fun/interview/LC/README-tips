  ** Ask clarifying questions before jumping to answer 
  ** Keep simple names. (length, input, start, end, max, etc)
  ** break into small functions and test each one before writing the whole program
  ** Log important flow conditions with var values. Use String.format() for ease.
  ** start with simple case and make it work. iterate for complexity
  ** Manually verify the logic to make sure there are no bugs
  ** Do not add too many comments. wastes your time
  ** import java.util.* instead of multiple import
  ** keep super simple names and vars
